=head1 NAME

Reddit::Client::Thing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A "Thing" is the base class of all Reddit objects. 

Generally, consumers of the Reddit::Client module do not instantiate these
objects directly. Things offer a bit of syntactic sugar around the data
returned by reddit's servers, such as the ability to comment directly on
a Link object.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over

=item new($session, $data)

Creates a new Thing. C<$session> must be an instance of Reddit::Client.
C<$data>, when present, must be a hash reference of key/value pairs.

=back

=head1 INTERNAL ROUTINES

=over

=item set_bool($field, $value)

Sets a field to a boolean value of 1 or 0, rather than the JSON
module's boolean type.

=item load_from_source_data($data)

Populates an instances field with data directly from JSON data returned
by reddit's servers.
